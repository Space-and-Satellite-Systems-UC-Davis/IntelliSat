# Computer Systems Oribtal 
Welcome to code respository for the Space And Systems Satellite Club's REALOP 1 Flight Software! The code here will be run on our flight computer, the Orbital Platform, which will be responsible for controlling and monitoring the CubeSat's various subsystems. Details regarding the Orbital Platform are available on this github repository: [uwu64/orbital-platform](https://github.com/uwu64/orbital-platform).

**NOTE**: Several images of the board or connectors aren't attached yet since the Orbital Platform is back in Davis. Wait a few weeks and the images will be here.
