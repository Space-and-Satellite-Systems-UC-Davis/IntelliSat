 *		This is where the project combining both the HDD and
 *		sun sensor should go. By default, this is what will run
 *		from main.c when the entire project is ran. To change this,
 *		go to main.c under Src and replace the Test_ID with your intended
 *		test, such as 10 for HDD or 9 for sun sensors. For more complicated
 *		changes, go to TestDefinition.h under Src/inc.
