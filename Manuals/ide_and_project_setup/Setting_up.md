```

```
The rest of the necessary fields will fill up by themselved. Leave the others as is. Click `Next`. The window will display a list of branches to clone.

The code can't be built and tested yet. To allow for that, go the the `Project Explorer` and click on `Import Projects...`. In the *Import* window, click on `Existing Projects into Workspace` under the `General` section.

In the next window, select the `Select root directory` option. Make sure the directory is the workspace directory, where the repo from earlier was cloned. *Intellisat* must be visible as a project. Make sure it's selected, then click `Finish`. When done, the Intellisat project will be visible in the Projects window.

## IntelliSat Project Properties
**NOTE**: The following settings should already be configured through the *.cprojects* file, but still check them to be on the safer side.

With the Intellisat project selected in the *Projects* window, press `Alt + Enter`. A properties window will open. Navigate to `C/C++ Build -> Settings`. Make the following changes:

Click `Apply and Close`. Now the project can be worked on.
